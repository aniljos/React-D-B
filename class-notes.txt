JSX

	- User-defined components must start with an upper-case.
	- JSX is JS expressions
		- const jsx = (<p> Hello </p>)
	- <> </> = React Fragment(typically used for a root element in JSX)
	
props
	- The component author defines the props to the component.
	- props is always an object
	- props is used to pass data from a parent to a child component and vice-verse
	- Changes to props will re-render the component.
	- props is always read-only in the child component
