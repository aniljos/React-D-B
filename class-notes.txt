JavaScript
	- Interpreted: No compilation
	- Dynamic - static typing
	- OOPs - Not class oriented
	- Versions 
	
Framework
	- Support for the latest versions and features of React
	- Server-side rendering(SSR) and SEO features
	- Stability & Optimized
	
Vite Project Files
	- package.json - npm configuration file
	- tsconfig.json - typescript compiler config
	- vite.config - Vite config
	
	- index.html - single page
	- main.tsx - entry point script
	- App.tsx - Root Component(Main) 
	
Command
	npm create vite ==> npx create-vite
	
	npm - install, uninstall, list, create
	npx - run a tool(without install the tool)
	
Components
	- functional(recommended)
	- class
	
	- client-side rendering(CSR)
	- server-side rendering(SSR) - from React 18: optimizations, SEO
	
JSX
	- Everything is a component(div, p etc)
	- HTML elements are components referred to as instrinsic components(start with a lowe case)
	- User-defined components must start with an upper-case.
	- JSX is JS expressions
		- const jsx = (<p> Hello </p>)
	- <> </> = React Fragment(typically used for a root element in JSX)
	- Conditional rendering: use the ternary operator
	- Iterate over an array/collection: use the map method
	
props
	- The component author defines the props to the component.
	- props is always an object
	- props is used to pass data from a parent to a child component and vice-verse
	- Changes to props will re-render the component.
	- props is always read-only in the child component
	- <Message text="abc" />  => props.text 
	- <Message> <p>test</p> </Message> => props.children
	
state
   - useState
   - state must be treated as immutable
			- create a copy, change the copy and update the state with the copy.
   - state changes will a re-render
   - state change is asynchronous.
   - setState overloads
		- setState(nextValue)
		- setState(callback)=> (prevValue => nextValue)
   - state changes are batched
         - counter = 5
		 - setCounter(counter + 1); => batch => setCounter(6) => batch invoked => counter - 6  
         - setCounter(counter + 1); => batch => setCounter(6) => batch invoked => counter - 6 
		 
		 - setCounter(prevCounter => prevCounter + 1); 
				=> batch => setCounter(invoke the callback)= batch invoked => counter - pCounter + 1 =6
         - setCounter(prevCounter => prevCounter + 1);   
				=> batch => setCounter(invoke the callback)= batch invoked => counter - pCounter + 1 =7
	
useEffect(effects)
	- implements side-effects(async operations) in a component
	- useEffect(setUp, [list of dependencies]);
	- mounted(after its mounted on the UI)
		- useEffect(setUp, [empty dependency array]);
		- api calls to the server(executed only once)
		- DOM initializations
		- Add listeners to events on the window or document and DOM objects
		- mount happens after the first rendered
	- unmount(before unmounted)
		- cleanup method of the mount effects
		- cancel the incompleted api calls
		- Remove listeners to events on the window or document and DOM objects
		- Any cleanup code
		
forms
	- controlled input
		- Reactive, better user-experience
		- associate a state with each form field, 
		- onChange eventhandler, value property
		
	- uncontrolled input
		- Non-reactive, faster
		- get a handle to the form field
		- useRef hook to get handle to any HTML Element including form fields)
		
		
Http calls from the browswer
	- XMLHttpRequest(low-level)
	- fetch (HTML 5)- high-level
	
	
	http status
		- 100 (information)
		- 200 (success)
		- 300 (redirect)
		
		- 400 (client error)
		- 500 (server error)
		

Promise
	- proxy object
	- are either resolved or rejected
	- .then method => successCallback, errorCallback
	- .catch method => errorCallback
	
	- async and await(preferred)
		- will work only with promises
		- write code asynchronous code with a synchronous behavior
		
useRef
	- create a mutable reference
	- the value is retained across mutiple renders
	- will not trigger a component re-render
	- Used to store a handle of a DOM(HTML) element.
	
CSS
	- define a local css
	- style attribute(inline style) or class attribute
	
	
Exercise:
	Create new route /customers
	Add a component: ListCustomers - lined to the route /customers
	Display all customers form api GET(http://localhost:9000/customers)
	Use HTML table.
	Create a model for customer
	
Session State
	- Browser
		- localStorage - persistant
		- sessionStorage - session
		- Cookies 
	- Memory
		Redux, React Context

Redux
	-high-level api
	-store
		- one store
	-reducer
		- one reducer
		- designed in a way to have multiple reducers and combine to a single reducer.
		- must be synchronous. Cannot invoke any async calls(api calls)
		
	-actions
	
	- pattern : action creators
		- helper method to create an action. Example: createLoginAction(), 
	
	- middleware
		- intercept the action: validate, logging, async 
		- async middleware library: redux-thunk, redux-saga 
	
	-react-redux
		-library intergrate React with redux
		- Provider component to integrate the redux store to react component tree.
		- Hooks
			- useDispatch: return a dispatch function to dispatch as actions
			- useSelector: select(read) data from the store
			- useStore: return a handle to the store
	
	- redux toolkit
		- library that provides api and components to work with redux 
		- implemention of the common design patterns that are recommened to the used.
		- slices: 
			Allows use to treat state as mutable
			replace reducers
		
React Context
	- Share data/state across the component tree
	- low-level api
	- Multiple context per application
	- Hooks
		- useContext: accessing the context
	- Changing the context and rendering the component(s) is not in-built
		- to implement re-rendering: useState, useReducer
	
	

	
Endpoints for customers

	GET, POST, PUT, DELETE http://localhost:9000/secure_customers
	GET, POST, PUT, DELETE http://localhost:9000/customers
	
Exercise:TodoList.tsx
		1. In the list(table) display "isCompleted" as a checkbox
		2. Bind the checkbox to the redux store: tods.items[i].isCompleted. Do it using a controlled input
		3. When the user checks/uncheck the checkbox the value to be updated in redux.
	
Hooks(core)
	- useEffect
	- useState
	- useRef
	- useContext
	- useReducer => like the useState, but to change the state dispatch an action
	- 
	
Optimization of Component
	- React.memo => memoize a component
		-function, higher-order component(HOC)
	- useCallback => memoize a callback
	- useMemo => memoize a value(object/number/string/array)
	- Code spliting
	- Virtual DOM 
	
Micro Front-ends
	- Webpack Federation
	- Vite MFE
	
	
higher-order component(HOC)
	- Design pattern
	- a function that receives a component and returns a new component 
	- it used to inject behaviors to a existing component.
	
Design guidelines
	- Smaller components
		- modularity, easy maintain, testing is easy, better for optimizations
	- Design for reuseablity
		- component
		- HOC - class & functional 
		- Custom hooks - functional
	
Next.js project
	- app folder
		- layout.tsx => main/root component
			- application layout
		- page.tsx(default page)
			- root route (http://localhost:3000/)
	- App Router
		- File-based routing
		- Support Client and Server components
		- Default is always a server component.
		- 'use client' directive to mark a component as a Client component
		
React Server Components: SSR, SSG, ISR
	- SSR
		- component receives props
		- component is reading request headers/cookies
		- disable caching( fetch api's)
		- enable SSR explicitily: export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'
	- SSG
		- no dynamic behavior in the component
	- ISR	
		- Is SSG with revalidate property
		
API's(Http endpoints) -> Nodejs(JavaScript)
	- Http package
	- Node Express - Web application
	- Next.js - Full stack; React FE and a Nodejs BE
	
Database
	- MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB
	- SQLLite(Embedded)
